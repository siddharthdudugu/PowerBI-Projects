# Financial_Sales_Report_using_PowerBI

Project Overview:
This project aims to demonstrate the process of financial data analysis using Power BI. Through four steps, I'll guide you through various aspects, including the Power BI interface, data loading and validation, creating reference files, and establishing relationships between data tables. By the end of the project, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage Power BI for financial analysis tasks.

Step 1: Introduction to Power BI for Financial Data Analysis
In this step, I introduce myself as a certified data analyst and Microsoft Certified Trainer. I provide an overview of Power BI and its advantages for financial data analysis. We explore key features of a sample financial data report, including card visualizations, treemaps, matrix visualizations, and column charts.

Step 2: Data Loading and Validation in Power BI
Step 2 focuses on the process of loading, validating, and transforming data in Power BI. I demonstrate how to load data from an Excel file, ensuring its cleanliness and readiness for visualization. We learn how to visually inspect the data, validate its integrity, and make necessary adjustments using the query editor.

Step 3: Creating Reference Files and Establishing Relationships
In Step 3, I explain the importance of reference files for accurate sorting and tracking of profits by calendar year. We learn how to create a reference table, define relationships between tables, and ensure proper sorting of data for visualization.

Step 4: Building Visualizations 
In the final step, we utilize our clean and referenced data to create visualizations that effectively communicate financial insights. I demonstrate how to build visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts to analyze financial data trends and patterns. Finally, we conclude the project with a summary of key learnings and next steps for further exploration.
